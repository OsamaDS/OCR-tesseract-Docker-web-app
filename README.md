# OCR-tesseract-Docker-web-app
This project is about extracting text from different card images. This is a complete web app, developed through FASTAPI and deployed through docker. Dockerfile is also
present in it. The main thing in this project is to use tesseract ocr engine in docker because there are some settings needed in the environmental variables of systems
for processing through tesseract OCR engine. So those who want to use tesseract in their project and they needed to deploy that project, so for them Dockerfile is very
important. They can take help from this Dockerfile. Thanks!!!
